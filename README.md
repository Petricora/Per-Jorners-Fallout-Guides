# Per Jorner's (slightly modernized) Fallout 1 Walkthrough

<p>A modernized copy of the excellent Fallout 1 walkthrough written by Per Jorner. No changes were made to the text itself.
<p>This version also contains a backup of the original work should its source ever be lost.

---

<p>Changes mirror those of my edits to the [Fallout 2 walkthough](https://github.com/Petricora/Per-Jorners-Fallout2-Walkthrough):
  
- Restored the background from the original version.
- Changed the default font.
- Justified the text body (inital reason for this entire endeavor).
- Moved style elements from HTML to CSS.
- Used more modern HTML conventions (e.g. `<b>` -> `<strong>`).
- Reformatted the tables for readability.

> _The main thing you will find in FO1 is there is less of everything. Of course, it should come as no surprise that the first game in the series would be smaller than the sequel. Less equipment choices, less quests, a smaller world map, less perks, less NPC control (but also less bugs). Having cut your teeth on FO2, you may sometimes feel a little restricted in FO1. Still, the gameplay and story are just as strong, and except for a few control (interface) issues that were improved for FO2, you are going to love FO1 just as much. One aspect in which FO1 is not smaller than FO2 is in it's overall level of kickass-ness._
