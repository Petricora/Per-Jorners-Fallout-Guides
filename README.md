## The (slightly modernized) copies of Per Jorner's Ultimate Fallout 1&2 Guides

A modernized edit of the excellent Fallout 1&2 guides written by Per Jorner. No changes were made to the text itself.

Contains a backup of the original work (in the [files](https://github.com/Petricora/Per-Jorners-Fallout-1-Walkthrough/tree/master/Fallout_guide_files) folder) should its source ever be lost.

---
- Restored the background from the original version.
- Justified the text body (inital reason for this entire endeavor).
- Moved style elements from HTML to CSS.
- Used more modern HTML conventions (e.g. `<b>` -> `<strong>`).
- Reformatted the tables for readability.
